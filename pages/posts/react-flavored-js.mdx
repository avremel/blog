# React Flavored JavaScript

<Aside pTags={

    `The goal is to demonstrate how to create stateful + reusable components with JS/jQuery. I'm picking on React because that's what I know best.`,
  ]} />

Picture yourself in prehistoric times, lurking in a den of DOM mutations and jQuery. State is `hidden` in innocuous looking `input` fields. `event`'s are left loose to propogate. How can we take the hardened lessons of modern web frameworks and apply them to a codebase which eschews any sense of order?

**Of the first order is clarifying the utility of modern frameworks**

- **Components** which **encapsulate** fragments of HTML for reuse. Those fragments can include behavior, as well as [styles](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) scoped to a component.
- These components are **stateful**. State is _not_ declared in the ether, but safely ensconced within a component. A checkbox has enough self awareness to answer the question, "Am I `checked`?", without excavating the DOM.
- State is **transparent**. `console.log` your state and know your DOM. A convenience brought to you by [One Way Data Binding](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34519889/can-anyone-explain-the-difference-between-reacts-one-way-data-binding-and-angula). The DOM can bubble up `events` but is powerless over mutating `state`. That privilege belongs to your component.
- Components can be **customized** by ingesting variables. Parent components can **react** to children by passing in callbacks.

## Retrofitting these ideas in JavaScript...

...by way of example.

<PaginatorWrapper />

☝️ is a component built with modern JS.

### Compenent interface

[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/jquery-2mfqsw?file=index.js)

```js
PaginateBar = new PaginateBarComponent({
  selector: '#paginate-bar',
  onChange: (newPageNum) => (// API call or whatever),
  children: `
    <div style="color: Tomato; font-style: italic;">
      MY DASHBOARD
    </div>
  `,
});

PaginateBar.setValues({
  pageNum: 3,
  perPage: 50,
  totalRecords: 377,
  totalPages: 8,
});
```

**Notice how we are micking React**
- The component [attaches itself to a selector](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html#rendering-an-element-into-the-dom).
- `constructor` and `setValues` ingest [`props`](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html).
- Consumers can provide an `onChange` callback.
- Arbitrary HTML can be included via [`children`](https://reactjs.org/docs/composition-vs-inheritance.html#containment).

### Component definition

[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/jquery-2mfqsw?file=paginate_bar/index.js)

```js
class PaginateBarComponent {
  #selector;
  #onChange;
  #children;
  #pageNum;
  #perPage;
  #totalRecords;
  #totalPages;

  constructor({ selector, onChange, children }) {
    // constructor props
    this.#selector = selector;
    this.#onChange = onChange;
    this.#children = children;

    // setValues() props
    this.#pageNum = null;
    this.#perPage = null;
    this.#totalRecords = null;
    this.#totalPages = null;

    Object.preventExtensions(this);

    this.#setInitialDOM();
  }

  setValues({ pageNum, perPage, totalRecords, totalPages }) { ... }

  isLoading(value) { ... }

  #setInitialDOM() { ... }

  #updateDOM() { ... }
}
```
**We are leveraging modern-ish JS**
- [Classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) for **encapsulation**.
-  [Private fields and methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields) provide a measure of **safety**.
- [Object.preventExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/preventExtensions) disables new fields.
- [Template tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) for defining chunks of HTML. It's the closest you'll get to [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html).

## Tell me more

- This approach obviates the need for a build step.

- Modern frameworks provide guardrails to keep you on the beaten path. JavaScript is the wild west in comparison and requires *much* more discipline.

- Whereas React effectively tracks `prop` changes and triggers rerenders, we must explicitly notify our component of `prop` changes via `setValues`.

- Traditionally, you render HTML upfront and mutate on demand. React allows you to declare your UI, and manages DOM updates for you ([docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html)). We _could_ emulate this approach by tearing down the DOM on `prop/state` change, [but why would we?](https://svelte.dev/blog/virtual-dom-is-pure-overhead)

## In Conclusion

If you have a hight tolerance for discomfort, jQuery + modern JS can be a mediocre subsitute for React-like frameworks. You will lose the awsome DX (Developer Experience) but you only have yourself to blame 😉.
