## The problem
With GA4, triggering a `purchase` event on checkout completion is straightforward[^1]:

```json
  {
    transaction_id: "T_12345_1",
    value: 25.42,
    tax: 4.90,
    shipping: 5.99,
    currency: "USD",
    items: ...
  }
```

If a user cancels their order or removes an item, you can simply send a `refund` event[^2].

The sum of these events - purchases minus refunds - is reflected in `Reports > Total Revenue`.

How can you report on `refund` events which don't happen in the browser? It is fairly common for a user to cancel their order over the phone or for an order to get flagged as fraud.

## Solution 1: CSV Upload

You can upload a CSV of `transaction_id`'s[^3]. The obvious drawback is that you need to manage refunds manually. Another caveat:

> **You should wait 24 - 48 hours** before importing the refund data to make sure the original transaction is present in the account.

## Solution 2: Measurement Protocol

> The Google Analytics Measurement Protocol for Google Analytics 4 enhances measurement for web and app streams by sending events directly to Google Analytics servers in HTTP requests. You can record server-to-server and offline interactions, and send them as Measurement Protocol events to Google Analytics, where they can be viewed in reports.[^4]

This seems like the ideal solution for programatically sending "offline" `refund` events.

#### How to validate the request

> The Google Analytics Measurement Protocol for Google Analytics 4 does not return HTTP error codes

You will need to validate your API request using the Event Builder UI[^5] or by calling the validation endpoint: `/debug/mp/collect`.

#### What data do you need to send?

The schema is roughly:

```json
  {
    "client_id": "client_id",
    "events": [{
      "name": "refund",
      "params": {
        "currency": "USD",
        "transaction_id": "T_12345_1",
        "value": 12.21,
      }
    }]
  }
```

`client_id` is a unique identifier stored by GA4 in the `_ga` cookie and looks something like `GA1.2.908899769.1600020018`[^6]. If you have BigQuery linked to GA4, it shows up as `user_pseudo_id`.

You can retreive the `client_id` from the cookie and store it in your database at checkout time, or by querying BigQuery:
```sql
SELECT
  user_pseudo_id AS client_id,
  params.value.string_value AS transaction_id
FROM
  `MY_ANALYTICS_TABLE.events_*`,
  UNNEST(event_params) params
WHERE
  params.key = 'transaction_id'
  AND params.value.string_value IN ("T_12345_1")
```

#### Open Questions
- Why does the `refund` event require a `client_id`, isn't the `transaction_id` enough? The CSV upload doesn't require a `client_id`.
- Why is there no way to batch `refund` events for multiple users?
- Do I need to wait 48 hours after a `purchase` before sending a `refund` event? The CSV upload has this requirement, but it's unclear if it applies to the Measurement Protocol as well.
- If I send a `refund` event before a `purchase` event gets ingested, does it get discarded?

> :point_right: A timestamp can be added using the `timestamp_micros`. However, the protocol only supports timestamps less than 72 hours ago. _If_ you have to wait 48 hours to send a refund event, the refund timestamp might be stale by the time it reaches the API, causing the event to get rejected.

## How to debug refund events

I haven't figured out how to inspect individual refund events in the GA4 UI using `Explore` since the UI is shockingly bad. Instead, I'm using the BigQuery integration to verify that events are coming in correctly. The queries I've been using:

#### Refund events for a specific day

```sql
  SELECT
    user_pseudo_id,
    event_timestamp AS refund_timestamp,
    event_name AS refund_event_name,
    (SELECT value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'transaction_id') AS refund_transaction_id,
    (SELECT COALESCE(value.int_value, value.double_value) FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'value') AS refund_amount
  FROM
    `MY_ANALYTICS_TABLE.events_*`
  WHERE
    event_name = 'refund'
    AND event_date = '20230926'
```

#### Refund events with matching purchase events for a specific day

```sql
  WITH purchases AS (
    SELECT
      user_pseudo_id,
      event_timestamp AS purchase_timestamp,
      event_name AS purchase_event_name,
      (SELECT value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'transaction_id') AS purchase_transaction_id,
      (SELECT COALESCE(value.int_value, value.double_value) FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'value') AS purchase_amount
    FROM
      `MY_ANALYTICS_TABLE.events_*`
    WHERE
      event_name = 'purchase'
  ),
  refunds AS (
    SELECT
      user_pseudo_id,
      event_timestamp AS refund_timestamp,
      event_name AS refund_event_name,
      (SELECT value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'transaction_id') AS refund_transaction_id,
      (SELECT COALESCE(value.int_value, value.double_value) FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'value') AS refund_amount
    FROM
      `MY_ANALYTICS_TABLE.events_*`
    WHERE
      event_name = 'refund'
      AND event_date = '20230926'
  )

  SELECT
    r.user_pseudo_id,
    r.refund_timestamp,
    r.refund_event_name,
    r.refund_transaction_id,
    r.refund_amount,
    p.purchase_timestamp,
    p.purchase_event_name,
    p.purchase_transaction_id,
    p.purchase_amount
  FROM
    refunds r
  LEFT JOIN
    purchases p
  ON
    p.purchase_transaction_id = r.refund_transaction_id
```
